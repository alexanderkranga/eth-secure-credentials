## SecureCredentials

This is a simple smart contract that acts as a password manager and allows to store user credentials (usernames and passwords). The main focus of this project is to build a CI/CD system around the app on Ethereum blockchain, that includes automated testing, Solidity code coverage reporting, gas monitoring, overall system monitoring and alerting. The logic of the app itself is not a priority and it is never going to be used on Ethereum mainnet.
